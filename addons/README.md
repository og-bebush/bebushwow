# How to use and install addons

This guide will cover basic addon installation

## ElvUI

> Note: If you're still installing the WoW client, it's better to wait until installation is finished.

Before launching WoW:
1. Download ElvUI ZIP file from the addons dir.
2. Open up WoW client directory (either via launcher or manually by path `C:\Path\To\WoW_7.3.5_26124`)
3. Find the addons directory by path `C:\Path\To\WoW_7.3.5_26124\Interface\AddOns`
4. Extract ElvUI ZIP in the addons directory

Now open up WoW
1. Enter the game
2. You'll be greeted by ElvUI configuration window, you can skip it.
3. Press `Esc` key, find and click on "ElvUI" button

From here you can either configure everything manually or use our pre-configured profiles.

> Note: you can change setup anytime, so if you pick pre-configured, you can change anything anytime.

1. **Manually:** look up for ElvUI configuration guide.
2. **Pre-configured:**
  - Find `*.txt` file for your role (e.g. if you are Damage Dealer, then find DD.txt);
  - Open the file (you don't need to download it)
  - Copy the gibberish
  - In WoW, open ElvUI settings, find "Profiles" tab, click on "Import" button and paste the gibberish there.
