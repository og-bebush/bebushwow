## Leveling guide

### Tips:
- For faster lvling, it's better to get somebody maxxed out to help.
- By default, all chars start with LVL 1, but there are some exceptions:
    1. Demon Hunter: LVL 98;
    2. Death Knight: LVL 55;
    3. Monk: LVL 80;

### 1-20
Pure agony of WoW Classic leveling. 

Doesn't matter if you're solo or somebody is helping - you need to get **solo** exp by killing mobs and doing quests. That means that you **should not be in party** until LVL 20.

### 20-60

- **Party:** find any Classic dungeon. Just make a party group, fly/walk to the dungeon entrance, enter. Highlvl needs just to gather as much mobs as possible, kill by packs. Be careful, cuz large packs could trigger oneshot meachincs on low-lvl char;
- **Solo:** the same agony of quest leveling;

### 60-80

Same thing as for LVL 20-60, but in the location - **Outlands**


### 80-98

You should get Pandaria quest. It will be either auto-issued or just appear in Orgrimmar. After reaching pandaren islands, either kill mobs (again no party) or go to any dungeon. 

### Legion

After reaching LVL 98, you'll be soloing most of the time due to the questline.

1. **"Legion comeback"** quest should appear. If doesn't appear, it should be in Orgrimmar. Anyway TP to Orgrimmar and find the quest.
2. Go through starter questline, until you get the quest in Orgrimmar port.
3. Go to the port, finish quest, speak to the NPC, watch a cutscene of you and your team transporing to Dalaran.
4. Go through the Dalaran quest, until Kadghar quest with flying to Surramar or until you end up on **"Broken Isles"**.

Now it gets messed up.

5. You need to open initial **"Broken Isles"** locations with smaller dailies. 
6. Additionally, upon reaching Dalaran, and finishing initial quests, **orange quest mark** should appear within Dalaran. It is a quest to your artefact weapon. It's important questline, go through it **immediately** when you get the quest.

> Note: From here it's better to stick to this [questline roadmap](https://forum.uwow.biz/threads/gajd-cepochka-kvestov-argusa-i-dostizhenie-34-teper-vy-gotovy-33-34.286142/)

7. While doing quests look for **"The Hands Fate"** as this quest is the most important. 
8. When you'll get THF quest, TP to Orgrimmar, do the quests. You should be transported to Azuremyst Isle.
9. Get Vindikar to the Argus.

Congrats, now you can start endgame content.

10. From there you need to finish questline ASAP, so you'll get all 3 locations discovered - Antoran Wastes, Krokuun и Mac'Aree.

### Endgame

Aight, it's time to get down to business.

First things first, make sure you finished Argus questline and you have all 3 locations discovered.

From there, start pushing daily quests:
- Open the map
- Find any daily
- TP to nearest beacon and complete the quest

Additionally, Illidan will give you another daily quest which requires finishing Gates. Assuming you have just started, the best option will be either to ask somebody in Discord or just enter the gates and wait until other people will join.

Let's talk about rewards:
- **Argunite:** The most important thing to ever exist for fresh chars. There is a vendor on Vindikar - **Vashreen** (he's located on the bottom level of the ship). He's selling item tokens for 650 argunite per piece. Each token will grant you an item of 910 ILVL, which is a really great thing to have;
- **Scrolls for the artefact exp:** one of the most important things. You'll obtain these everywhere on Argus - quests, mobs, etc. With this scrolls you can LVL up your artefact weapon, which will allow you to LVL up artefact passives;
- **Items of 885+ ilvl:** it's a great thing to fastly obtain base-level equipment. Once you get almost all items 885+, skip these dailies if they don't drop Argunite;
- **Relics:** additional item for artefact weapon. Each weapon have 2+ slots for relics of different types (blood/ice/fire/iron/magic/etc.). Look for relics of your weapon type.

Now you're ready to push dailies.

Next thing is also really important - your Class Hub. In this hub you can obtain weekly rewards that drop items of different ILVL, **keys**, scrolls and other stuff.
Additionally, hubs provide unique room where you can lvl up your artefact

## Mythic Keys

### Foreword
First, let's clarify the goal of the keys: high-tier keys could give you legendaries, as well as 960+ ilvl items. After obtaining ~960 ilvl on a char, it could be counted as a maximum reaching point. In order to get BiS items (T20/T21 sets, and other items) you need to push Argus Raid (20+ version).

Due to the fact that our party is really small, we cannot push Argus, so for now our goal is to push Mythic+ Keys until maxxed out ilvls on our main chars.

After we reach high ilvl on out mains, we're planning to join some raids with randoms in order to get better items.

If somehow we will expand to at least 10 members, there is a chance of making our own raid static party.

### How to obtain keys?

It's kinda simple, cuz there are three pretty straightforward ways:
1. Go to any Mythic (non key) dungeon with your party or randoms. Upon finishing the dungeon, you'll obtain a Mythic Key as a reward. Dropped keys are used in a certain dungeon that is picked randomly by system. Fresh key difficulty is also a random number between 1 and 4.
2. If you finished any key by the end of the week, you can obtain a reward from your Class Hall with a Mythic Key at the same difficulty as your highest completed key, or 1-3 levels higher. For example, if you finished 3 different keys with difficulty 10/15/20, then your reward key will have difficulty in range 20-23.
3. After successfull completeion of any key, you will be rewarded with the key of the Mythic key of a higher difficulty.


### How to push keys?

3. Make a party of 5 chars (1 tank, 1 healler, 3 dds)
4. Go to the dungeon location **on feet**
5. Before entering the dungeon, make sure that your difficulty is set to Mythic!
6. Enter the dungeon. At the very start there should be an interactable object, like a small statue or a wase. Click RMB on it, insert the key, make sure that everybody is in the dungeon and start.
7. From there dungeon will be counted as Mythic+. Your party will be given with the timer (20-40 minutes, time depends on the difficulty). 
8. Your goal is to kill each boss that is in the list (below the timer), and do it before timer reaches the end.

Note that for each party member death there will be a penalty: -30 sec from timer.

If your party will not finish the key under given time, consider the key failed, cuz you'll not be rewarded and the key will not be returned.
