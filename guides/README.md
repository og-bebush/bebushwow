## Leveling guide

### Tips:
- For faster lvling, it's better to get somebody maxxed out to help.
- By default, all chars start with LVL 1, but there are some exceptions:
    1. Demon Hunter: LVL 98;
    2. Death Knight: LVL 55;
    3. Monk: LVL 80;

### 1-20
Pure agony of WoW Classic leveling. 

Doesn't matter if you're solo or somebody is helping - you need to get **solo** exp by killing mobs and doing quests. That means that you **should not be in party** until LVL 20.

### 20-60

- **Party:** find any Classic dungeon. Just make a party group, fly/walk to the dungeon entrance, enter. Highlvl needs just to gather as much mobs as possible, kill by packs. Be careful, cuz large packs could trigger oneshot meachincs on low-lvl char;
- **Solo:** the same agony of quest leveling;

### 60-80

Same thing as for LVL 20-60, but in the location - **Outlands**


### 80-98

You should get Pandaria quest. It will be either auto-issued or just appear in Orgrimmar. After reaching pandaren islands, either kill mobs (again no party) or go to any dungeon. 

### Legion

After reaching LVL 98, you'll be soloing most of the time due to the questline.

1. **"Legion comeback"** quest should appear. If doesn't appear, it should be in Orgrimmar. Anyway TP to Orgrimmar and find the quest.
2. Go through starter questline, until you get the quest in Orgrimmar port.
3. Go to the port, finish quest, speak to the NPC, watch a cutscene of you and your team transporing to Dalaran.
4. Go through the Dalaran quest, until Kadghar quest with flying to Surramar or until you end up on **"Broken Isles"**.

Now it gets messed up.

5. You need to open initial **"Broken Isles"** locations with smaller dailies. 
6. Additionally, upon reaching Dalaran, and finishing initial quests, **orange quest mark** should appear within Dalaran. It is a quest to your artefact weapon. It's important questline, go through it **immediately** when you get the quest.
7. While doing quests look for **"The Hands Fate"** as this quest is the most important. 
8. When you'll get THF quest, TP to Orgrimmar, do the quests. You should be transported to Остров лазурной дымки.
9. Get Vindikar to the Argus.

Congrats, now you can start endgame content.

10. From there you need to finish questline ASAP, so you'll get all 3 locations discovered - Antoran Wastes, Krokuun и Mac'Aree.

## Endgame

Aight, it's time to get down to business.

First things first, make sure you finished Argus questline and you have all 3 locations discovered.

From there, start pushing daily quests:
- Open the map
- Find any daily
- TP to nearest beacon and complete the quest

Additionally, Illidan will give you another daily quest which requires finishing Gates. Assuming you have just started, the best option will be either to ask somebody in Discord or just enter the gates and wait until other people will join.

Let's talk about rewards:
- **Argunite:** The most important thing to ever exist for fresh chars. There is a vendor on Vindikar - **Vashreen** (he's located on the bottom level of the ship). He's selling item tokens for 650 argunite per piece. Each token will grant you an item of 910 ILVL, which is a really great thing to have;
- **Scrolls for the artefact exp:** one of the most important things. You'll obtain these everywhere on Argus - quests, mobs, etc. With this scrolls you can LVL up your artefact weapon, which will allow you to LVL up artefact passives;
- **Items of 885+ ilvl:** it's a great thing to fastly obtain base-level equipment. Once you get almost all items 885+, skip these dailies if they don't drop Argunite;
- **Relics:** additional item for artefact weapon. Each weapon have 2+ slots for relics of different types (blood/ice/fire/iron/magic/etc.). Look for relics of your weapon type.

Now you're ready to push dailies.

Next thing is also really important - your Class Hub. In this hub you can obtain weekly rewards that drop items of different ILVL, **keys**, scrolls and other stuff.
Additionally, hubs provide unique room where you can lvl up your artefact
