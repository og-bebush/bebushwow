2. Find "Files" tab in top navigation bar;
3. Find "Download ULauncher for Windows";
4. Download the launcher, open it;
5. In the right bar, find **Legion** at the top (under UWOW.BIZ tab) and select it;
6. Proceed with install;
7. While WoW client is installing, [register your account here](https://cp.uwow.biz/auth/register?invite=3084419)

### Additional

For better experience [get ElvUI addon](./addons)

 ## First steps in game

 1. After you launched the game, for your own ear safety, open the settings, find Sounds tab and reduce sounds to at least 20% or lower
 2. Login with your credentials

Now let's make your first char

> Note: idk if Uwow offers cross-fractional parties, so it will be safer to make your char from **the Horde**

You can pick any class you want, it will not actually matter.
Some tips, if you wanna:

| Tank            |  Heal       | DPS Melee        | DPS Range   | Hybrid  |
|-----------------|-------------|------------------|-------------|---------|
| Demon Hunter    | Paladin     | Demon Hunter     | Warlock     | Paladin |
| Death Knight    | Druid       | Rogue            | Hunter      | Priest  |
| Warrior         | Shaman      | Monk             | Mage        | X       |

### Leveling and further steps

> Note: Please, notify anybody on Discord server, so we can add you to the guild in WoW.

First thing that you'll see is ElvUI greeter, just skip it and continue with the ElvUI guide we provided.

Aight, now your char is ready. Leveling is kinda easy due to the x100 rate, so you can level up within couple of hours.


### Max level

Congrats, now you reached max level. Now you can experience "latest" content:

1. Try to open up all locations in Broken Isles ASAP (you can do it by continuing the questline).
2. Each opened location will give you daily quests with nice rewards.
3. Also check your Class Hall (it will be introduced by some quest, after reaching Dalaran and maxing out the level) - here you can obtain your spec legendary weapon and do some char progress.

## Keys and content

We're only pushing Mythic Keys, so no raids, no Raid Times and stuff.

If you wanna play and/or make a party for the key, use Discord bot with polling system.
